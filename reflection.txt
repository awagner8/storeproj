During this assignment Avi and I worked through the thought process behind all of the code together in Perkins, and 
each did the actual code for one section of the project. Avi wrote the code for asile manager and I wrote the code for store
manager but we each sat with eachother and helped eachother work through each of our sections and answer questions 
and made sure that we understood what we were doing in each part of the assignment.
